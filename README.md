### TDD Humble Object
Uma view serve apenas para mostrar informações ao usuário e/ou receber instruções deste. Input/Output, nada de processamento. Todo processamento/lógica que interage com a view deve ficar em classes separadas, a interação entre estes deve ser através de parâmetros em funções tipo "CarregarUsuarios(AUsuarioView)", assim esse objeto poderá ser testado através de um mock da view "CarregarUsuario(AUsuarioViewMock)". Essa view desacoplada do processamento/lógica é chamada de "Humble dialog" no padrão humble objeto. 
* Este padrão é basicamente o uso do SRP do SOLID após ser devidamente esclarecida a responsabilidade da view (input/output com o usuário)?
* Um MVC implementado de acordo poderia fazer isso também?
